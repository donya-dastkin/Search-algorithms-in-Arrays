# Search algorithms in Arrays 

### Arrays are widely used in programming and various arrays can be implemented on arrays.

### One of the most important arrays is search in array!!

### Search arrays in arrays can be implemented in various ways To implement these arrays, we have to design algorithms so that we can implement them easily.

>#### Algorithms are problem-solving methods that consist of a finite sequence of well-defined instructions !

### Search algorithms are so important that every programmer should know about them and be able to implement them.

### Here, we implement array search algorithms first with Javascript and then with Golang.

#### TIP : Programming is not related to syntax and programming language and has no effect on the logic of the program and its execution; But programming is about your logic and problem solving skills.
