# Search algorithms in Arrays 🔎

### Arrays are widely used in programming and various arrays can be implemented on arrays.📍

### 📌 One of the most important arrays is search in array!!

### Search arrays in arrays can be implemented in various ways To implement these arrays, we have to design algorithms so that we can implement them easily.

>#### ‼️ Algorithms are problem-solving methods that consist of a finite sequence of well-defined instructions

### Search algorithms are so important that every programmer should know about them and be able to implement them 😄

### Here, we implement array search algorithms first with Javascript and then with Golang 👩‍💻😃

#### 💥 Programming is not related to syntax and programming language and has no effect on the logic of the program and its execution; But programming is about your logic and problem solving skills.
